# RemoteAdmin

**RemoteAdmin** is a lightweight, modular Remote Administration Tool (RAT) for Windows, designed for **legitimate system management, monitoring, and educational use**.  
It provides a simple client-server architecture that allows administrators to manage connected machines, send commands, and monitor status in real time.

## Features

- **Client–Server Architecture** — Secure communication between remote clients and the central server.  
- **Modular Design** — Easy to extend with new commands or monitoring capabilities.  
- **Real-Time Command Execution** — Send and execute commands remotely on connected clients.  
- **System Information Retrieval** — Gather basic system info (CPU, RAM, OS, user).  
- **Secure Protocol (Planned)** — TLS encryption and authentication coming soon.  
- **Windows Native** — Built using C# and .NET for Windows environments.

## Extending Functionality

You can easily extend `RemoteAdmin` by adding new commands to the **Shared** project and implementing corresponding logic in both the **Client** and **Server** modules.

Example:
1. Define a new message type in `Shared/Packets`.
2. Implement handling logic on the server side.
3. Add response handling in the client.
